## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze Citibike ride trip data during the month of August to determine if there were any patterns in the data that might be useful when creating a new bike rideshare company in Des Moines, IA.

## Results

The first chart clearly shows that their is a peak in ridership between 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. This clearly makes sense as this is a time when workers would be commuting from work to home.

The checkout times by gender is the first chart that clearly shows that men are more likely than women to use Citibikes for transportation. This could be an anomaly due to only looking at a month's worth of data.

The checkout times by user clearly shows that most users only ride a bike with Citibike for up to 20 minutes. Longer trips are less likely to happen due to either the cost of longer rides or due to the strenuous activity of long biking.

The first heatmap shows that on weekdays, peak ridership occurs during the commuting hours before and after work. Another time when peak ridership occurs is on Saturday throughout the day. This makes sense intuitively as New Yorkers would be looking for a fun way to enjoy the summer activities in NYC.

The next heat map is the second clear indication that Men prefer Citibike to Women. One factor that could lead to the clear difference rides by gender is due to safety issues in NYC for women when commuting alone.

The top starting locations are all clearly in Manhattan. This makes sense as Manhattan is one of the most dense buroughs of New York while also being easily accessible via bike.

The last chart shows that subscribers are more likely to ride Citibike than Customers. This could be due to the costs that one-time customers have when riding Citibike.

## Summary
In summary, there is a large difference between New York, NY and Des Moines, IA. It is tough to determine based off the above analysis if a bikeshare would work in Des Moines as Iowans are more likely to drive cars in the city as this is more convenient for Iowans. Two future visualizations that should be done is looking at ridership data in a smaller city as well as visualizing Des Moines transportation patterns.
