## Summary
In summary, there is a large difference between New York, NY and Des Moines, IA. It is tough to determine based off the above analysis if a bikeshare would work in Des Moines as Iowans are more likely to drive cars in the city as this is more convenient for Iowans. Two future visualizations that should be done is looking at ridership data in a smaller city as well as visualizing Des Moines transportation patterns.
